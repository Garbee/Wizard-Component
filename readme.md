# Wizard Component

A simple wizard component for use with Material Design Lite.

Material Design does not provide guidance for wizards at the current time. So the styles provided are inspired by Material Design but do not adhere to any particular part of the specification.

This component is currently undergoing major development. For all that is holy do **NOT** use this in production. No stability offered at this time.
